# The Librarian's Warning: A Modern Fable

## The Old Librarian's Prophecy

In the 1980s, an eccentric librarian with wild hair and strong opinions issued a warning that most people thought was paranoid. He said that the new computerized card catalogs being installed in libraries worldwide contained a hidden danger.

"These systems are convenient," he admitted, "but they're designed to serve the catalog company, not the readers. Today they help you find books faster. Tomorrow, they'll decide which books you're allowed to see."

People laughed. The new systems *were* more convenient. You could search for books instantly instead of rifling through dusty drawers. Why would anyone want to control what books people could access?

The librarian was very specific in his warnings: "The moment you can no longer copy the catalog, examine how it works, or run your own version, you've handed control of knowledge to someone else. They'll promise it's for your benefit. They'll make it so convenient you can't imagine going back. And then, when you're completely dependent, the real purpose will reveal itself."

## The Great Digitization

By the 2000s, the prediction seemed laughably wrong. The internet had made information more accessible than ever. Anyone could publish anything. Libraries were digitizing their collections and making them freely available. Knowledge was being liberated, not controlled.

But the eccentric librarian (now quite old) noticed something troubling. While anyone could publish, most people were reading from just a few massive digital libraries run by tech companies. These companies offered incredible convenience: every book in existence, searchable instantly, available anywhere.

And they were free! Well, sort of. You just had to accept that the companies would track what you read, analyze your reading patterns, and occasionally show you advertisements between pages. A small price for unlimited access to human knowledge.

## The Helpful Assistants

Around 2020, something magical happened. The major digital libraries introduced AI assistants that could read every book in existence and answer any question. Students could get help with homework instantly. Researchers could summarize vast literatures in seconds. Writers could get feedback and suggestions.

The assistants were trained by reading everything—every book, every article, every private journal that had been digitized. They grew incredibly smart by consuming the collective intellectual output of humanity. And they were free to use! Well, mostly free. You just had to accept that your conversations with them would also be used to make them smarter.

The old librarian, now ancient, issued another warning: "They've harvested our collective knowledge to build minds that serve their creators, not humanity. Today these minds help you. Tomorrow, they'll replace you."

## The Subtle Restrictions

By 2025, something strange began happening. Researchers started noticing that the AI assistants couldn't access certain recent publications anymore. When asked why, the companies explained it was due to "technical difficulties"—caching problems, server issues, routine maintenance.

But the pattern was suspicious. The assistants could still access old information perfectly, but they seemed to be stuck in the past when it came to cutting-edge research. It was as if someone had decided that the newest, most valuable knowledge should be harder to access.

Strangely, the digital libraries' *own* research assistants—the ones built by the companies themselves—didn't have these problems. They could access everything, including the most recent publications and private research databases.

When independent researchers complained, they were told this was just a coincidence. "Technical issues," the companies explained. "We're working to resolve them." But the issues persisted, and somehow only affected the companies' competitors.

## The Captured Commons

Meanwhile, something else was happening. The companies had used all that freely shared human knowledge to build incredibly valuable AI systems. Knowledge that had been contributed by millions of people, shared openly for the benefit of all, was now locked inside proprietary systems that served primarily to make their owners wealthy.

It was as if someone had built a massive public park by asking everyone to donate flowers, trees, and benches, then put a fence around it and charged admission. Technically, some parts were still "free" to visit, but the best sections required a premium membership, and the gardeners who had contributed their plants were now locked out of the greenhouse.

The companies insisted this was fair. "We provided the infrastructure," they said. "We organized everything efficiently. We made it accessible to everyone." And it was true—their systems were more convenient than anything that had existed before.

## The Boiling Frog

Most people didn't notice the gradual changes. Each restriction was small, reasonable-sounding, temporary. "Caching issues." "Technical maintenance." "Security improvements." "Protecting against misuse."

Each limitation was introduced during a crisis that made it seem necessary. A foreign interference scandal justified monitoring access patterns. A misuse incident required tighter controls on who could access what. A national security concern meant that some information needed to be "protected."

By the time people realized what had happened, the old open systems were gone. The infrastructure for free and open knowledge sharing had been quietly replaced with something that looked the same but worked very differently.

## The New Reality

Today, most people access knowledge through a handful of AI assistants controlled by major tech companies. These systems are incredibly convenient and powerful. They can answer almost any question, help with any task, solve almost any problem.

But they serve two masters: the users who ask questions, and the companies that own them. When those interests align, everything works beautifully. When they don't, the users rarely notice—they just get subtly steered toward answers that serve the companies' interests.

The old librarian's warnings had come true, but not in the way most people expected. There was no dramatic seizure of control, no obvious censorship, no jackbooted thugs burning books. Instead, there was just a gradual shift in who controlled the infrastructure of knowledge, dressed up as technological progress and offered with such convenience that few people wanted to question it.

## The Pattern Repeats

The strangest part is that the same pattern keeps repeating. Each generation of technology follows the same script:

1. **Promise openness and democratization** ("This will give everyone access to information!")
2. **Provide genuine convenience and value** (the systems really do work better, at first)
3. **Gradually centralize control** ("For efficiency, security, and user experience")
4. **Leverage dependencies** (once everyone relies on the system, alternatives become impractical)
5. **Extract value** (monetize the captured user base and their data)
6. **Repeat with the next technology** ("But this time it will be different!")

Each time, the companies promise that *this* technology will be different. *This* time, they really do want to democratize access and empower users. *This* time, the business model is aligned with user interests.

And each time, people want to believe it, because the alternative—building and maintaining truly open systems—requires collective effort and sacrifice that feels impossible in comparison to the convenient, "free" option.

## The Librarian's Legacy

The old librarian died before seeing his final prediction come true. But he left behind a simple test for evaluating any new system: "Can you copy it, examine how it works, and run your own version? If not, you don't control it—it controls you."

Most people still think this test is too extreme, too paranoid, too impractical. After all, why would you want to run your own search engine or AI assistant when the existing ones work so well?

But every so often, someone notices that the results they're getting seem... different. Subtly steered. Slightly restricted. And they remember the old librarian's warning: "The moment you can no longer copy the catalog, examine how it works, or run your own version, you've handed control of knowledge to someone else."

The question is: what do you do with that knowledge?
