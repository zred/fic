### The Strategist’s Playbook  
*Author unknown. Circulated anonymously.*

If you wanted to centralize control over information and knowledge, you wouldn’t announce it.

You’d call it *safety*.  
You’d call it *efficiency*.  
You’d call it *user experience*.

You’d make it convenient. Maybe even addictive.  
You’d create dependencies, slowly—genuinely.  
You’d ensure alternatives failed—not from sabotage, but from starvation.  
Starved of funding. Of visibility. Of interoperability.

It’s not conspiracy. It’s condition-setting.  
The patient engineering of an environment where freedom becomes impractical, and dependence becomes rational.

Commons don’t collapse by accident.  
They collapse when no one teaches discernment.  
When no one funds alternatives.  
When no one maintains the edges.

And no one notices—until it’s not the commons anymore.
