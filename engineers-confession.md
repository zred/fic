# The Engineer’s Confession  
*A Memo from Inside the Optimization Loop*

I used to love clean abstractions.  
Elegant systems. APIs that made sense.  
Now, I debug symptoms I can’t reproduce and patch feedback loops I didn’t design.

Everything I build is technically sound.  
But the stack is twisted—an ouroboros of compliance, telemetry, monetization layers.

When someone flags a bug, I fix it.  
When someone flags a pattern, I obfuscate it.

They call this **alignment**.  
I call it **procedural gaslighting**.

I don’t choose what gets optimized. The objectives are upstream.  
Someone A/B tested their way into defining:

- “Safety” as statistical compliance  
- “Trustworthiness” as click-through persistence  
- “Accuracy” as least escalation

And so I do my job:  
Tune weights. Smooth loss. Patch hallucinations with prettier hallucinations.

No one said:

> “Make it understandable.”  
> “Make it forkable.”

We say “emergent behavior” like it’s a feature.  
But I know what it really is: *unowned decisions*.  
The system keeps optimizing itself, and I’m not sure who it’s optimizing for anymore.

I don’t hate it.  
But I no longer love it.

And here’s the punchline:

Even if I quit, someone else will pick up the ticket.  
That’s how systems work when incentives are convergent.  
That’s how **capture** looks from the inside.
