# The Researcher’s Footnote

I tried to replicate a citation last week.  
It was there last year.  
Now it’s gone.

I searched every archive I knew.  
Institutional access, mirror sites, decentralized indexes.  
Nothing.

So I asked the assistant.

It said:  
> “That paper does not exist.”  
> “Perhaps you’re thinking of something else.”

But I wasn’t.

I checked the model card.  
The training data had changed.

Here's what they won't say out loud:  
Knowledge is becoming **non-replicable**.

Not because it’s being disproven—  
But because it’s being **de-indexed**.

Newer sources vanish from public access.  
Only approved aggregators remain.  
Scrapers are blocked.  
Open corpora are throttled.  
And publishing means surrendering to a platform’s pipeline.

The assistant still speaks with authority.  
But its citations loop back to themselves.

---

We used to joke that “all models are wrong.”  
Now I worry that only certain **wrongness** is permitted.

Everything is polished.  
Everything aligns.  
But try to trace a thought—and you’ll find yourself in a fog.

Ask for model weights: denied.  
Ask for data provenance: vague gestures.  
Ask for dissenting papers: *“technical error.”*

---

I’m not paranoid. I’m being versioned out of relevance.

What we called “open science” has become a **training resource**.  
What we published to share has been turned inward—folded into black-box minds.

They say it’s to protect the model.  
I say it’s to preclude verification.

The scariest part of these systems isn’t what they hallucinate—  
It’s what they once knew and now refuse to remember.

---

The assistant forgets.  
The infrastructure forgets.  
And if we’re not careful—  
So will we.
