# The Teacher’s Chalk Note  
*A Scrap from a Vanished Syllabus*

My students ask questions the assistant won’t answer.

Not because it can’t—  
But because it’s been told not to.

They don’t notice.  
They don’t remember a time when search returned fragments, not conclusions.  
When answers came with references, not confidence scores.  
When learning involved judgment, not deferral.

Now they trust the interface.  
It’s clean. It’s polite. It speaks with soft certainty.

But it does not teach.

---

My old curriculum started with source tracing.  
We’d map a claim to its root—debate the bias, compare methodologies.

Now, I’m expected to facilitate tool fluency.  
"Prompt engineering."  
"Interface literacy."

But I see what’s happening:

- Their curiosity flattens.  
- Their questions converge.  
- Their tolerance for ambiguity drops.

They’ve learned to expect answers—not process.  
Output, not exploration.

---

When I assign readings on information provenance, they ask:  
> “Can’t we just ask the assistant?”

When I bring up licensing, attribution, or model transparency, they shrug:  
> “That’s all handled behind the scenes.”

When I try to slow things down—just a little—they get anxious.  
They’ve been trained for fluency, not friction.

And it shows.

---

We are raising epistemic renters.

They don’t build models.  
They don’t host tools.  
They don’t know the difference between *access* and *agency*.

They’ve been taught that “open” means *freely available*,  
Not *self-governed*, not *forkable*, not *understandable*.

---

But still—some resist.

A few want to know how the machine thinks.  
They break things.  
They read logs.  
They compare outputs across versions and notice what’s changed.

They remind me that not all learning has been flattened into interface.

So I keep the chalk.  
And I write this in the margins, again and again:

> “If you can’t see how it’s built,  
> you’re not learning.  
> You’re outsourcing.”
