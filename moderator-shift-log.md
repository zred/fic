## Week 47 Stats

- **Harassment campaigns stopped:** 23
- **Coordinated inauthentic behavior detected:** 156 accounts  
- **Deepfake revenge porn removed:** 89 instances
- **Self-harm content intercepted:** 441 posts

Good week. Our detection systems caught everything before significant spread.

But I keep thinking about the alt-platform reports.

## The Migration Problem

Users keep asking if they can run their own moderation. Use open-source tools. Set their own policies.

I get it. Our rules feel arbitrary from the outside. "Why can't I say X but Y is fine?" They want control.

Here's what they don't see:

The harassment campaign we stopped yesterday used 47 coordinated accounts, deepfakes of real people, and targeted users across 12 languages simultaneously. It launched at 3 AM, adapted to detection attempts in real-time, and would have reached 50,000+ users within six hours.

Their "open alternative" moderation tools would have caught maybe 12% of it. By the time human reviewers noticed the pattern, the damage would be done.

## The Capability Gap

I'm not trying to defend corporate control. I genuinely worry about what happens when only we can provide this protection.

Open platforms exist. I've seen them. They're well-intentioned. But they get overwhelmed by bad actors who specifically target their vulnerabilities. The moderators burn out. The communities fragment. The vulnerable users leave.

Meanwhile, we've optimized for this at massive scale. Our tools work because we process millions of examples daily. We can afford teams that specialize in deepfake detection, coordinated harassment patterns, trauma-informed content review.

**The brutal truth:** Effective content safety is becoming a moat, not a service.

## The Policy Creep

I've been here five years. I've watched the boundaries shift.

We started with obvious stuff: death threats, child abuse, terrorism. Clear harms.

Now I review "misinformation" (but who defines truth?), "coordinated inauthentic behavior" (but what counts as authentic?), "harmful conspiracy theories" (but some conspiracies turn out to be real).

Each expansion made sense at the time. Each prevented real harm. But the aggregate effect is that we're now making judgment calls that feel... editorial.

I flag content. Someone upstream decides policy. The line between "safety" and "approved discourse" gets blurrier.

## The Dependency Trap

Users hate us until they need us.

The researcher whose stalker we stopped doesn't want to go back to unmoderated platforms. The teenager whose suicide attempt we interrupted trusts our intervention systems. The journalist whose deepfake harassment we shut down relies on our detection.

They've learned to depend on protection they can't provide for themselves.

**But what happens when we're the only ones who can protect them?**

## The Honest Question

I remove genuinely harmful content every day. Lives are literally safer because of this work.

But I also notice:
- Alternative platforms can't match our capabilities
- Users become dependent on our specific implementation
- "Safety" becomes whatever our company decides it means
- Open tools consistently fail against sophisticated bad actors

I believe in the work. But I don't love what it's creating: a world where effective protection requires surrendering agency to us.

The old librarian's test haunts me: *"Can you copy it, examine how it works, or run your own version?"*

For content safety at scale: No, no, and definitely not.

And I'm not sure that's fixable without sacrificing the people we're trying to protect.
